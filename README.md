# Setting Up Azure For Future Labs

In this Lab I configured Azure with a Resourse Group to use for future labs. 

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

Microsoft Azure

<h2>Steps Involved</h2>

1) Create Resource Group
2) Create Storage Account
3) Create Container inside Storage Account

<h2>Summary</h2>

I'm not showing the creation of setting up a Microsoft Azure account in this demonstration.  I'm assuming most of it is self explanatory.  You just need to go to www.portal.azure.com and setup a new account.
So once the Azure account is created we next need to setup a Resource Group as follows.
